# How to get started?
1. Get a **UUID for SERVICE and CHARACTERISTIC** -  a unique number used to identify services, characteristics and descriptors, also known as attributes. These IDs are transmitted over the air so that e.g. a peripheral can inform a central what services it provides. Use this website: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
    - **Why do you need this?** In BLE, UUIDs for services and characteristics are the only standardized way to uniquely identify what your device offers and where its data lives. The service UUID tells other devices what kind of functionality you provide, and the characteristic UUID tells them exactly which data point or control they can access. Without these, a central has no reliable way to locate or interact with your data â€” your BLE device might as well be invisible in the GATT table.
