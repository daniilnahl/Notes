Tutorial on how to setup from zero: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLD9zggmop4

1. Select STM 32 Vs Code Extension in VS Code
2. Create the project
3. Name project and MAKE SURE TO SELECT Cmake FOR IDE
4. Back IN VS code select "Import CMake project" and import it
5. After import you will have errors popping out, build the project (bottom left) and the erros will disappear.


NOTE: cant open the .ioc file from the inside of VS code. Work around is opening the project through Cube IDE and opening the file there.
