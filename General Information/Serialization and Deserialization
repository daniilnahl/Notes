**Serialization** and **Deserialization** refer to the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then converting it back into its original form.
- **Serialization**: Converting an object to a storable or transmittable format (e.g., binary or JSON).
- **Deserialization**: Converting serialized data back to its original form for use in the program.
#### **Serialization**:
Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. This format is typically a **byte stream** or **text** (like JSON, XML, or binary).

For example:
- A Python object (like a dictionary, list, or a custom class instance) is serialized into a format (e.g., a byte stream or JSON string) that can be saved to a file.
- **Pickle** in Python is a popular module for serializing objects into binary format. You can also serialize data to formats like **JSON**, **XML**, or **CSV** for human-readable formats.
- Stock tracking App uses it to save an instance of a watchlist.
#### **Deserialization**:
Deserialization is the opposite process of serialization. It involves converting the serialized data back into its original object or data structure, so it can be used again in the program.

For example:
- If you serialized a Python dictionary into a byte stream, deserialization will convert that byte stream back into the original dictionary.
- **Pickle** or **JSON** (for text-based formats) can also be used to deserialize data.
### **Why Use Serialization and Deserialization?**
1. **Persistence**:
    - Serialization allows you to save the state of an object (like a program’s configuration or a user's data) to a file so it can be used later.
    - Example: Saving a user’s preferences (like settings or a watchlist) to a file so it can be restored the next time the application runs.
2. **Data Transmission**:
    - Serialization is used when sending data over a network (e.g., in web APIs or between services). It ensures that data can be easily transferred between different systems or platforms.
    - Example: Sending a Python object over the internet to another system using JSON or binary data.
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**:
    - Serialization allows data to be shared between different systems, platforms, or languages, as the serialized format can be interpreted by different technologies (e.g., JSON being used across web applications).
