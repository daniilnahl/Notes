### Vocabulary
- **Edge Impulse**: Deploys MLs on microcontrollers, helps pick the right model.
- **Sensi ML**: like Edge Impulse, but for detecting data paatterns on sensors.
- **TVM**: Complier/Optimizer, take existing ML models and optimizes them to run extremely efficiently on microcontroller, CPUs, GPUs and other hardware.
- **GCC**: C/C++ compiler.
- **TFLu** - interpreter that runs pre-trained ML models on a microcontroller.
- **CI/CD** - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. A method of software engineering that allows fast delivery of new versions of code.
    - Continous Integration:
    - Continuous Delivery:
- **function overload** - having multiple functions with the same name within the same scope, but with different signatures (different numbers or types of parameters). This allows a single function name to be used for different, but related, operations based on the input arguments. 
- **determinstic**: means that the system produces the same result every time given the same input.
- **probabilistic**:
- **NPU**:
- **Scalar data type**: capable of holding a single value.
- **Aggregate data type**: capble of holding collection of values.
