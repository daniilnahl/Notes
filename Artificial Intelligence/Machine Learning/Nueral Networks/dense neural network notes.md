# What are Dense Neural Networks?
Neural network where each node in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer.
 - Consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer.
 - Every neuron in this layer is connected to one in the next layer.
 - They are part of supervised ML.
