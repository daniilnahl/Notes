# What are Dense Neural Networks?
A Dense Neural Network (DNN), also known as a fully-connected network, is a fundamental type of neural network where each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer. This architecture ensures that information from all neurons in one layer is passed to the next.

# How does a Dense Neural Network work?
Input data is fed into the network, and as it passes from one layer to the next, it undergoes a linear transformation (multiplication by a weight matrix) followed by a non-linear activation function. Through training, the network learns the optimal weights to map the input data to the desired output.

# Why is it important?
DNNs are highly versatile and serve as a powerful general-purpose tool for many machine learning tasks. They are particularly effective for problems involving structured or tabular data and are often a component within more complex network architectures.

# When to use it?
Use a dense neural network when your input data lacks a spatial or temporal structure, such as data from a spreadsheet, database, or a set of flattened sensor readings. It is an excellent choice for standard classification and regression problems.
