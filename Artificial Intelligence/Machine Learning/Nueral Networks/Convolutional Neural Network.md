# What is CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a specialized class of neural network designed for processing data that has a known, grid-like topology. 
- EXTREMELY GOOD FOR image and video.

# How does it work?
CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution. They employ special layers with filters (or kernels) that slide across the input data to detect specific features, such as edges, corners, and textures. Subsequent layers combine these low-level features to detect more complex, higher-level patterns like objects or faces.

# Why is it important?
The key advantage of CNNs is their ability to automatically learn a hierarchy of spatial features directly from the input data. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering.

# When to use it?
Use a CNN whenever your data has a spatial relationship, primarily for image recognition, object detection, and video analysis. They can also be adapted for other data types, such as audio (by converting it to a spectrogram) or certain time-series data.
