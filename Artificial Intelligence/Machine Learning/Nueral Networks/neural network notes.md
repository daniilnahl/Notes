# What is a Neural Network?
A Neural Network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. It is comprised of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized into layers. These networks are designed to recognize complex patterns and relationships in data.

# How does it work?
Data enters through an input layer and is processed through one or more hidden layers before a result is produced at the output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which is adjusted during training via an algorithm like backpropagation. This process allows the network to "learn" from examples without being explicitly programmed.

Example: A neural network can learn to predict stock market prices by analyzing historical price data, trading volume, and other relevant economic indicators.

# Why is it important?
Neural networks excel at solving complex, non-linear problems where the relationships between inputs and outputs are not easily defined. 

# When to use it?
Use neural networks when dealing with large, complex datasets, especially when traditional machine learning algorithms are insufficient. They are well-suited for tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and machine translation.
