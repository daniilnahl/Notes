# What is a Neural Network?
1. Neural - inspired by the way biological neurons work in the human brain process. Basically, x value is fed into a function which produces a y value.
2. Network - network of neurons/nodes connected by a set of weight. 
    - *INPUT LATER  |  HIDDEN LAYER  |  OUTPUT LAYER*
    -  Bias 1       |  Bias 1        |
    -  Input 1      | hidden node 1  | output node 1 -> output 1
