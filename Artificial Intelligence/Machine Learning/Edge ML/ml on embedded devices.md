# What is embedded machine/TinyML learning?
Machine learning models deployed on embedded systems (microcontrollers).
- its **probabilistic** in nature, meaning there's a probability it will do something if an event/condition is met, unlike traditional embedded systems which are **determinstic**, they are guaranteed do something when a threshold is met. 

# How to use Tiny ML?
1. Use ML software frameworks:
    - Open source CMSIS-NN Library:
        - Enables Cortex-M processors for tinyML applications.
        - Supports TensorFlow lite for MCUs.
        - Basically is used to optimize TFLu (very good at it too).
    - AIMET:
    - TensorFlow Lite:
    - CoreML:
    - PyTorch Mobile:

# When to Tiny ML used?
- **Vibration and motion**: predicitive maintenance, pollution, vibration.
- **Voice and sound**: keyword spotting, speech recognition, NLP, sound recognition.
- **Vision**: object detection, face unlock, classification.
