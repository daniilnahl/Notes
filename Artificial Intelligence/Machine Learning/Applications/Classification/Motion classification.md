# What is Motion Classification?
Its a ml task that automatically identifies and categorizes physical movements. It primarly uses data from motion sensors to recognize specific movements. 

# How does it work?
The process involnves collecting data, splitting it and then extracting features from it. Features are fed into ML model which output a predicted class. 

- *Example* - A wearable fitness tracker uses motion classification to distinguish between walking, running, and cycling by analyzing accelerometer data patterns.

# Why is it important?
Allows devices to be context-aware, allowing them to understand user behavior and interact with physical world. Foundation for applications in health monitoring, human-computer interaction, and sports analytics.

# When to use it?
Use motion classification when you need a system to recognize and respond to specific human activities. It is ideal for projects involving gesture control, fall detection for the elderly, or automated activity logging in smart devices.

**Tips & Tricks:**
- Ensure your training data captures a wide variety of ways a single motion can be performed to make your model more robust.
