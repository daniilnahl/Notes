# What is it?
Audio classification is the task of assigning a descriptive label to a sound recording. The goal is to teach a machine to recognize and categorize different types of sounds, such as speech, music, animal noises, or environmental sounds like a car horn or breaking glass.

# How does it work?
An audio signal is first converted from a raw waveform into a feature representation, most commonly a spectrogram or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). This representation, which captures the unique characteristics of the sound, is then used as input to a machine learning model. The model learns to map these features to predefined sound categories.

- *Example*: A smart home security system uses audio classification to detect the sound of a window breaking and subsequently trigger an alarm.

# Why is it important?
It enables machines to perceive and interpret their auditory environment, a critical capability for voice assistants, surveillance systems, and industrial monitoring.

# When to use it?
Employ audio classification when you need a system to identify specific acoustic events. This is useful for applications like keyword spotting ("Hey Siri"), predictive maintenance based on machine sounds, or wildlife monitoring by identifying animal calls.

# Tips & Tricks
- **MFCCs** are an excellent feature choice for tasks involving human speech, as they are designed to mimic the human auditory system.
- **Use data augmentation**, such as adding noise or shifting the pitch, to create a more diverse training set and prevent overfitting.
