# What is it?
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior of a dataset. These unusual instances are known as anomalies, outliers, or novelties.

# How does it work?
An anomaly detection model is first trained on a dataset that represents "normal" behavior. When new data is presented, the model assesses how closely it conforms to the learned normal patterns. Data points that fall outside a learned boundary or have a low probability score are flagged as anomalies.

- *Example*: A credit card company uses an anomaly detection system to identify fraudulent transactions by flagging purchases that deviate from a user's typical spending habits.

# Why is it important?
This technique is crucial for identifying critical but rare events that could have significant consequences. It is widely applied in cybersecurity for intrusion detection, in finance for fraud detection, and in manufacturing for identifying equipment failures.

# When to use it?
Use anomaly detection when your primary goal is to find rare and unusual occurrences within a large volume of data. It is particularly valuable in systems where the vast majority of data is normal and you are only interested in the exceptions.

# Tips & Tricks
-**The quality of your "normal" training data is paramount;** ensure it is clean and truly representative of normal operating conditions.
