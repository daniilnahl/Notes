# What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that revolves around developing algortithms and programs that can learn over time, specifically learning from data.

**There are categories of ML**
1. **Supervised learning**: 
    - Model is trained on labeled data and based on that makes inferences.
    - Types: classification and regression.
    - Made up of these algortithms:
        - *Regression algorithms*—predict output values by identifying linear relationships between real or continuous values.
        - *Classification algorithms*—predict categorical output variables (e.g., “junk” or “not junk”) by labeling pieces of input data. 
        - *Neural networks*—simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes that can facilitate processes like natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition and image creation.
2. **Unsupervised learning**: 
    - Model is not trained on any data. Model draws inferences from identifying patterns in provided data.
    - Uses cluster analysis, which uses clustering algorithms to categorize data points according to value similarity (as in customer segmentation or anomaly detection).
3. **Self-supervised machine learning**:
    - Model trains itself on unlabeled data and through that creates its own labeled datasets.
4. **Reinforcement learning**: 
    - Model is trained using a system of reward and punishment. An agent is given a task to reach a pre-determined goal and a human punishes and rewards it based on what it does. Through time it learns the best way to reach that goal.
5. **Semi-supervised learning**:
    - Model is given a small labeled data set and a big unlabeled data set then the model uses a mix of unsupervised learning to identify data clusters, afterwards uses supervised learning to label those data clusters.

## What are limitations of Machine Learning?
1. **Computing power requirements** add fuel into the fire that is climate change.
2. **Data** required for machine learning raises privacy concerns over sensitive data.
3. **Type of data** used for machine learning can perpetuate stereotypes/misinformed points. For example, a group of people from region A have less education due to a war thus they score less on SAT, machine learning doesn't know that context and will just show that based on data people in region A score less which could perpetuate a sterotype that people from that region are less intelligent.




# Vocab
**Inference** - prediction aka when a pre-trained model makes a prediction on a new set of data.
**Prediction serving** - process of client asks for inference -> supply new data -> server responds with result.
