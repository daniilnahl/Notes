## 1. What is a Queue?

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed.

## 2. Why does it work this way?

The queue has two main operations:

* **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear.
* **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front.

Queues are useful when processing tasks in the order they arrive.

## 3. How to use it?

* View examples (in files).

## 4. When to use?

* Use them when you need to use the FIFO principle.
* For task scheduling, network traffic management, and buffering.
* For graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighboring nodes first before moving to the next level. It works like spreading ripples in waterâ€”starting from a source and expanding outward.
