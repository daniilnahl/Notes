zip() - combines list and dictionaries into one.

## LIST:
list = ["apple", "banana"] - list stores multiple datasets at the same time. Like array in other programming languages. 
Lists can have multiple variable types in them. Ex: TODO_LIST = ["workout", 3.1434, False]
Nested lists are lists stored inside a list. For example a list called student which stores info on a student stored in a list called students which hold multiple students.
- .append('') - adds a new element into a list and puts it at the end.
- .index(#index, '') - inserts a new element at specified index.

- .values() - reveals all the values of a dictionary
- .keys() - reveals all the keys of a dictionary
- .items() - reveals keys with their according value
