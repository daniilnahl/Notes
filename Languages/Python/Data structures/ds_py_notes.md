Lists can have multiple variable types in them. Ex: TODO_LIST = ["workout", 3.1434, False]

.append('') - adds a new element into a list and puts it at the end.
.index(#index, '') - inserts a new element at specified index.

.values() - reveals all the values of a dictionary
.keys() - reveals all the keys of a dictionary
.items() - reveals keys with their according value
