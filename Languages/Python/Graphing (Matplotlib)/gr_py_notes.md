### WHY IS GRAPHING IMPORTANT?
    Helps understand datasets. 

### WHEN DO I USE GRAPHING?
    Use it when I need to present data in a readable and understanding manner. 

### HOW DO I USE GRAPHING?
    ALL EXAMPLES OF USAGE ARE IN .PY FILE.
    DO NOT:
        1. Manipulate the axis to show misleading results. Example: if student got 80 and anoter got 90. Set the min y value to 0 to show that both of their scores are pretty high.
        2. Cherry picking data. Show the big picture.
        3. Wrong graph for wrong context. Look up what each graph is useful for before using it.

    TYPES:
        Scatter plot: a graph that shows the relationship between two variables using dots, where each dot represents a data point.
        Line chart:  a type of data visualization where individual data points are connected by straight lines.
        Bar plot:  a straightforward chart type. It is great for visualizing the count of items in different categories.
        Pie chart: good for visualizing percentages and fractional data.
        Density plot: visualizes the distribution of a continuous variable by smoothing data points into a continuous curve, showing the likelihood of values within a range.
        Contour plot: suitable for visualizing large and continuous datasets.
    
    Extending graphs: shows multiple charts in the same figure for comparison purposes or to give more depth of the story that you are telling. 
    Example in an election, you want one chart that shows the percentage, and another chart that shows the actual votes.
