### What allows comprehensions to exist in python?
    Iterators. Supporting iterators in your classes opens them up for use in comprehensions,
    forâ€¦in loops, and anywhere that Python works with collections. Your collection must implement
    a method called __iter__(), which returns the iterator. 

    The iterator also must provide a single method __next__() which returns the next value in the collection when iterator is called.
