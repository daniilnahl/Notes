#CUSTOM ITERATOR
# classical-era algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. To find
# prime numbers between 2 and an upper bound value, n, first, you must list all of the numbers in
# that range. Now, 2 is a prime, so return that. Then, remove 2 from the list, and all multiples of 2, and
# return the new lowest number (which will be 3). Continue until there are no more numbers left in
# the collection. Every number that gets returned using this method is a successively higher prime. It
# works because any number you find in the collection to return did not get removed at an earlier step,
# so it has no lower prime factors other than itself.

    def __next__(self): #defines next and the exit condition: condition. If there are no remaining numbers in the collection, then the iteration can stop.
        if len(self.candidate_numbers) == 0:
            raise StopIteration
        #Complete the implementation of __next__() by selecting the lowest number in the collection
        # as the value for next_prime and removing any multiples of that number before returning
        # the new prime
