### What is an Array?
    Its an indexed structure that holds mutiple values of the same type. (Primitive)

### What is a List?
    A dynamic array. They are dnyamic and resizable collections of elements. Can hold different types of elements as well.
    (More useful)

### When to use a List?
    When you need dynamic resizing (the number of elements is not fixed).
    Multiple data types.

### How to use an Array?
    Declare it: <element type>[] <name> = new <element type>[<length>];
    Length must always be declared.

    USEFUL ARRAY METHODS:
        copyOf(array, newSize): returns a copy of the array with the given size
        copyOfRange(array, startIndex, endIndex): returns a copy of the given subportion of the given array from startIndex (inclusive) to endIndex (exclusive)
        equals(array1, array2): returns true if the arrays contain the same elements
        fill(array, value): sets every element of the array to be the given value
        sort(array): rearranges the elements so that they appear in sorted (nondecreasing) order
        toString(array): returns a String representation of the array, as in [3, 5, 7]


### What is a Sequential Algorithm?
    An algorithm which starts in a sequnetial manner from first to last element. 
    Example in main.

### What is a Nested Loop Algorithm?
    A loop within another loop. Example in main.
