### What is OOP in Java?
    Similiar to other languages' OPP.
    Attributes are fields. (Properties and parameters).
    Functions are methods.
    Constructors are the same. (The process of initializing an instance of an object)
    Encapsulation(protecting an object's data from outside acess) is same.
    Setter is mutator(method that modifies object's internal state).
    Getter is accessor(method that shows object info).

    What are the key principles of OOP?
    1. Cohesion - the extent to which the code for a class represents a single abstraction. Reduce unnecessary dependencies among classes.

    

### How to create proper OOP in Java?
    Create:
    - toString method in your class for it to print something out, or it will just print symbols. 
    - this.[field] = [new field] (Java's way of saying self.x = new x)

    Creating different constructors:
    - public Point() {x=0; y=0;}
    - public Point(x, y) {this.x = x; this.y = y;}

    Encapsulation:
    - private int x;
    - private in y;


### MORE QUESTIONS:
- What is the difference between OOP and procedural? 
- The key difference is that procedural is a step by step code doing something while OOP stores data and has specific actions it can do with that data.
- OOP focuses on the "WHAT" you are working with.
- Procedural focuses on "HOW" you are doing something.
- Class is a template for an object(instance of that class).
