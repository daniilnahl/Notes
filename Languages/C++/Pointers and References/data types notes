1. What are the the primitive data types?
    Type - Meaning - Minimum Size(Number of bits)
    bool - boolean - NA
    char - character - 8 bits
    wchar_t - wide character - 16 bits
    char16_t - Unicode character - 16 bits
    char32_t - Unicode character - 32 bits
    short - short integer - 16 bits
    int - integer - 16 bits (min is max of short int)
    long - long integer - 32 bits  (min is max of int)
    long long - long integer - 64 bits (min is max of long int)
    float - single-precision floating-point - 6 significant digits
    double - double-precision floating-point - 10 significant digits
    long double - extended-precision floating-point - 10 significant digits


    Side notes:
        extern before variable allows the variable to be used in other files. Basically like public in java.

    NEVER MIx SIGNED AND UNSIGNED
    1. A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero); 
    2. An unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.

2. What are some Escape Sequences?
    newline \n 
    horizontal tab \t 
    alert (bell) \a
    vertical tab \v 
    backspace \b 
    double quote \"
    backslash \\ 
    question mark \? 
    single quote \â€™
    carriage return \r 
    formfeed \f

!!. Difference between Reference and Pointer
    1. A pointer can be reseated (point to another address), while a reference is fixed to one object.
    
3. What are References? (Compound Type: a type that is defined in terms of another type). Example: int &r = x;
    A reference defines an alternative name for an object. It refers to another type. Uses &(name) - (variable).
    A reference is bound to the variable it is assigned to. Must be intialized at the time it is defined.
    Reference can reference a pointer.

5. What Are Type Aliases? 
    A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type. Type aliases let us simplify complicated type definitions, making those types easier to use. Type aliases also let us emphasize the purpose for which a type is used.
    Example:
        typedef double wages; // wages is a synonym for double after this code.

6. What is cout, cerr?
    Cout is standard output while cerr is standard error output.

7. Headers, files and classes.
    If creating a class put the class name into the file name and create the file as a header file. Example: string.h
    #define, #ifnded and #endif all ARE MUST in header files to prevent re importing of the class.

    Preprocessors
        Program that runs before the compiler and changes the source text of our programs. Our programs already rely on one preprocessor facility, #include. When the preprocessor sees a #include, 
        it replaces the #include with the contents of the specified header.
