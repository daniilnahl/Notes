# Vocab
- **OOP**: Object Oriented Programming, revolves around the idea of an object which is an entity that combines data and functions into a single unit:
    - **Object**: entity that combines data and functions and acts as a single unit.
    - **Attributes**: data items/values of an object stored in its *member variables*.
    - **data hiding**: restricting data access and ability to modify to only certain members of an object.
    - **encapsulation**: bundling of an object's data and functions into a single entity.    
    - **Member functions**: functions that act on the attributes of the class. *There are these types:*
        - **Acessor/Get/Getter Function**: uses data but doesnt modify data. *Use 'get' in the name.*
        - **Mutator/Set/Setter Function**: uses data and modifies data. *Use 'set' in the name.*
        - **Constructor Function**: automatically called when an object of class is created ot init. the object. **NOTE**: class can have more than 1 constructor, but must **HAVE DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.**
            - **Constructor delegation**: In c++ a constructor in a class can call another constructor in the same class.
        - **Destructor Function**: member function automatically called when an object is destroyed. In c++ its, "~className". Only 1 is allowed.
