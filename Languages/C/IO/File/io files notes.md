## 1. What is it?

File handling in programming refers to the process of interacting with files on a storage device (like a hard drive). This involves operations such as:

* Opening files
* Reading data from files
* Writing data to files
* Closing files

## 2. Best time to use this?

File handling is essential when you need to interact with persistent data storage for various purposes:

* Read configuration settings from a file.
* Load data from a file to process it within your program.
* Save the results of a computation to a file for later use or analysis.
* Store user input or program output in a file.
* Interact with external data sources or log information generated by your application.

**TIPS:**

* Always check the return value of the file opening function (e.g., `fopen()` in C) to ensure that the file was opened successfully. If it returns `NULL`, it indicates an error (e.g., file not found, permission denied). Use `perror()` or similar functions to get more information about the error.
* Make sure to **close all files** using the appropriate closing function (e.g., `fclose()` in C) when you are finished with them. This is crucial to prevent data loss (buffered data might not be written until the file is closed) and resource leaks (the operating system resources used to manage the file handle are released).
* Be aware of the different file opening modes (e.g., `"r"` for read, `"w"` for write, `"a"` for append, `"r+"` for read/write, etc., and their binary counterparts like `"rb"`, `"wb"`) and choose the one that suits your specific needs.
* Implement error handling for potential issues that might occur during read and write operations (e.g., attempting to read past the end of the file, disk full errors during writing).
