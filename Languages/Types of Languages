## Compiler vs Interpreter (Methods of language execution)
|Feature|Compiled Languages|Interpreted Languages|
|---|---|---|
|**Execution Speed**|Faster|Slower|
|**Translation Process**|Ahead of Time (AOT)|Just In Time (JIT)|
|**Error Detection**|Before Execution|During Execution|
|**Dependency**|Standalone Executable|Requires Interpreter|
|**Flexibility**|Low|High|
A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution, while an interpreter translates and executes the code line-by-line as it is being run.
## Others
### **1. Low-Level Languages**
- **Definition**: These are closer to machine code, making them efficient but harder to write and understand. They directly interact with the hardware.
- **Examples**: Assembly Language, Machine Language.
- **Key Features**:
    - Fast execution.
    - Minimal abstraction from hardware.

**Example (Assembly Language)**:
`MOV AX, 5    ; Load 5 into register AX 
`ADD AX, 2    ; Add 2 to AX`
This tells the computer directly what to do using hardware registers.

---

### **2. High-Level Languages**
- **Definition**: These are closer to human language and easier to read, write, and maintain. They abstract away hardware details.
- **Examples**: Python, Java, C++.
- **Key Features**:
    - Easier to debug and understand.
    - Slower than low-level languages due to abstraction.

**Example (Python)**:
`x = 5 x += 2  # Add 2 to x`
This does the same thing as the assembly code above but is more readable.

---

### **3. Statically Typed Languages**
- **Definition**: Variable types are declared explicitly and checked at compile time, ensuring fewer runtime errors.
- **Examples**: C, Java, Go.
- **Key Features**:
    - Variables have fixed types.
    - Errors caught during compilation.

**Example (Java)**:
`int x = 5; x = "Hello";  // Error: Type mismatch!`

---

### **4. Dynamically Typed Languages**
- **Definition**: Variable types are determined at runtime, allowing more flexibility but potentially more runtime errors.
- **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
- **Key Features**:
    - No need to declare types.
    - Can lead to runtime type errors.

**Example (Python)**:
`x = 5 x = "Hello"  # No error here`

---

### **5. Procedural Languages**
- **Definition**: Focus on procedures or routines (functions) to perform tasks.
- **Examples**: C, Pascal, Python.
- **Key Features**:
    - Follows a step-by-step approach.
    - Code organized into procedures.

**Example (C)**:
`#include <stdio.h> void sayHello() {     
`printf("Hello, World!"); } 
`int main() {     sayHello();     return 0; }`

---

### **6. Object-Oriented Languages (OOP)**
- **Definition**: Use objects (data + behavior) to organize code. Focuses on classes and inheritance.
- **Examples**: Java, Python, C++.
- **Key Features**:
    - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Example (Python)**:
`class Dog:     def bark(self):         print("Woof!")  dog = Dog() dog.bark()`

---

### **7. Functional Languages**
- **Definition**: Emphasize immutability and use functions as the primary building blocks.
- **Examples**: Haskell, Lisp, Scala.
- **Key Features**:
    - Functions as first-class citizens.
    - Avoids changing state.

**Example (Haskell)**:
`square x = x * x 
`main = print (square 5)  -- Output: 25`

---

### **8. Scripting Languages**
- **Definition**: Typically used for automating tasks or controlling other software.
- **Examples**: JavaScript, Python, Bash.
- **Key Features**:
    - Often interpreted.
    - Quick for small tasks.

**Example (Bash)**:
`#!/bin/bash 
`echo "Hello, World!"`

---

### **9. Markup Languages**
- **Definition**: Used for structuring and presenting data, not traditional programming.
- **Examples**: HTML, XML.
- **Key Features**:
    - Tags for structuring content.

**Example (HTML)**:
`<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`

---

### **10. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**
- **Definition**: Designed for a specific task or domain.
- **Examples**: SQL (databases), R (data science), MATLAB (engineering).
- **Key Features**:
    - Limited to specific use cases.

**Example (SQL)**:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;`
