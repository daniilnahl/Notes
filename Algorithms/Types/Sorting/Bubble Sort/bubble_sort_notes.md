# What is bubble sort?
A sorting algorithm that compares 1st two elements and switches them if they are out of order. 
1. Moves down 1 element and repeats the comparison until the end of data structure. 
2. Then passes through data structure **again**.
3. Stops when **full pass resulted in zero switches.**

## What is the Complexity?
- Time complexity is 

## What are the Benefits?
- easy to understand.
- easy to implement.

## What are the Disadvantages?
- inefficent due to the number of exchanges. VERY SLOW FOR BIG data structures.
