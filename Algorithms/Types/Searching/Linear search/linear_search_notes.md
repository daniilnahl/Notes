# What is a linear search algorithm?
A sequential algorithm designed to search for a specific item. 

## What is the Complexity?
- Time complexity is the size of the data structure. So if you have an N array then time complexity is O (n). If you have a 2D array of N x M size then time complexity is O (n*m).
## What are the Benefits?
- easy to understand.
- easy to write.
## What are the Disadvantages?
- inneficient.
