# What is a Neural Network?
A Neural Network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. It is comprised of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized into layers. These networks are designed to recognize complex patterns and relationships in data.


# How does it work?
1. Data enters through an input layer.
2. It is processed through one or more hidden layers.
3. A result roduced at the output layer. 

## What happens in between layers?
There are connections between each layers and these connections have weights.

### Weights?
- Each connection between neurons has an associated weight. This weight defines how strong a connection is between two neurons. Weight can be on a scale from -1 to 1.
- Weights are adjusted during training via an algorithm. 

# Why is it important?
Neural networks excel at solving complex, non-linear problems where the relationships between inputs and outputs are not easily defined. 

# When to use it?
Use neural networks when dealing with large, complex datasets, especially when traditional machine learning algorithms are insufficient. They are well-suited for tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and machine translation.
