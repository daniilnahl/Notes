# What is an LLM?

## How are they trained?
1. Pretraining phase -> give it as much data as possible.
2. Supervised fine-tuning -> tune for some specific domain. 
    - instruction fine-tuning -> teaches LLM to actually chat with a person.
3. alignment (preference optimization) -> gives the LLM a boundary and ensures it's behavior aligns with what humans need.
