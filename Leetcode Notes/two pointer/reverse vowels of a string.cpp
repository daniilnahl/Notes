/****** 
 * WHAT WAS CORE IDEA?
The core idea was two use two pointers one starting at the beginning and one at end then intiate a while loop which holds smaller loops for each pointer to search for a vowel.
Search breaks when a vowel is found by a pointer. When both pointers find a vowel a swap of the values at the indices that pointers are pointing at occurs.
 * WHAT PATTERN/DSA DID THIS USE?
 * The DSA/PATTERN I used was two pointers.
 * 
 * Key concepts that I learned were:
 *  Key concept I reinforced was utilizing two pointers dsa method.
 *  I learned that contains() function doesn't exist in c++ 17/
 * WHAT TIME COMPLEXITY?
 * Time complexity is O (n) because I have only one loop that is iterating through the string of size n.
 * WHAT SPACE COMPLEXITY?
 * Space complexity is O (1) because the only variables I used were of fixed size.
 * WHAT IS THE SUMMARY OF THIS?
 * In summary utilized two pointer method to traverse a string and swap vowels.
