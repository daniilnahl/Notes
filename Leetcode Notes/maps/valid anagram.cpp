/********
 * WHAT WAS CORE IDEA?
 * The core idea of this solution was to count how many times unique chars appear
 * in both strings to see if they are anagrams. 
 * WHAT PATTERN/DSA DID THIS USE?
 * The DSA I used in my solution was a amp to count the frequnecy of chars in each string and then comparing the two maps.
 * Key concepts that I learned were:
 *    I can compare two maps using '=='
 *    I can access non-existing key in a map and it would default initialize it to 0.
 * WHAT IS THE SUMMARY OF THIS?
 * In summary, used hash map to do a TASK and if the outcome of doing TASK matched the wanted results return true.
 *TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N)
