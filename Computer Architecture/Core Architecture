### Computer Architecture 
The design and organization of core computer components such as CPU, memory and I/O interactions. This concept affects how the efficiently a system processes data.

#### Subfields
- [Instruction set architecture (ISA)](obsidian://open?vault=Coding&file=Microcontroller%20Architecture%2FInstruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)): gives instructions to CPU on how to communicate with hardware. 
- **Microarchitecture:** determines how internal components of the CPU are organized and interact. Basically, determines how the CPU handles the instructions from the ISA.
- **Memory subsystem architecture:** how data is stored, accessed, and retrieved across different types of memory. 
- [I/O subsystem architecture](obsidian://open?vault=Coding&file=Computer%20Architecture%2FIO%20Systems): handles the data transfer between CPU and external devices.

#### CPU 
##### What is it?
Central processing unit is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. The CPU receives data from memory subsystem. The two are connected by a [bus architecture](obsidian://open?vault=Coding&file=Computer%20Architecture%2FBuses%20Architecture).

CPU is made up of five core parts: arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers, program counter, control logic and data path.
##### How does it work?
- **Arithmetic logic unit**: where CPU performs mathematical operations. Usually, has two inputs and one output. 
- **Registers:** small, high speed memory locations that hold temp data which the CPU is working on(like scratch notes). Hold units of data of 8, 32, 64 bits.
- **Data path**: determines how information moves throughout the CPU.
- **Program counter**: keeps track of what the CPU is working on right now and will work on next.
- **Control logic**: the brain of the CPU. Reads the instructions and controls all other components to perform the instructions.



#### Memory Subsystem 
##### What is it?
There are **two** types of memory: Volatile  and non-volatile).
- RAM (Volatile): where data is stored fast, but temporarily. Volatile because data is lost when the power is turned off. 
- Long term storage(Non volatile): slow but larger than RAM. Stores data permanently (SSD, HDD). 

***Program Memory vs Data Memory***
- Program memory: where instructions for the programs you are running are stored. 
- Data memory: where information that the programs works with is stored.
CPU fetches instructions from program memory, executes them, and uses data stored in data memory to carry the instructions out.
