#### What is the bus?
A collection of wires and communication lines that allows different parts of a computer to send and receive data. 

**Three main types of buses**:
- Data bus: Carries actual data between the CPU, memory, and I/O subsystems.; the number of bits carried is usually the same as the CPU register size.
- Address bus: Transmits memory addresses so the CPU knows where to read or write data.
- Control bus: Sends control signals, dictating whether the CPU is reading, writing, or performing another operation.
